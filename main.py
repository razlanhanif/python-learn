# I am learning about print and how to set variable and use the variables


print("hello World")

name = "jon"
age = 12
print("Hello " + name)
print("Age is " + str(age))  # I am using number and covert to string by using str.

name = "amin"
print("My name is " + name)
print("Age " + str(age))


x = 12
y = 10
num = x - y
print(num)


# variable

x = 5
y = "amirah"
print(y + " is age " + str(x))

# snake case
my_character_name = "Alwin"

# camel case
myCharacterName = "Amin"
