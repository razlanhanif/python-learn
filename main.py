# I am learning about print and how to set variable and use the variables


print("hello World")

name = "jon"
age = 12
print("Hello " + name)
print("Age is " + str(age))  # I am using number and covert to string by using str.

name = "amin"
print("My name is " + name)
print("Age " + str(age))


x = 12
y = 10
num = x - y
print(num)


# variable

x = 5
y = "amirah"
print(y + " is age " + str(x))

# snake case
my_character_name = "Alwin"

# camel case
myCharacterName = "Amin"

# unpack list

kualaLumpur = ["Sentul", "Rawang", "Danau"]
a, b, c = kualaLumpur
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)


# adding plus sign (String)
x = "Amirah"
y = "is a boy"
print(x + " " + y)

# adding plus sign (number) become operation
x = 5
y = 6
print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x/y)
